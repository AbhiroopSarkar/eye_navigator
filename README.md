The Eye-Navigated Mouse project leverages cutting-edge Computer Vision techniques to enable hands-free control of a computer cursor. By utilizing modules such as cv2 (OpenCV), mediapipe, and pyautogui, this system tracks the user's eye movements in real-time, translating them into precise mouse movements. cv2 is used for video capture and processing, while mediapipe handles facial landmarks detection, specifically tracking the eyes. Finally, pyautogui maps the detected eye positions to cursor movements, creating an intuitive and seamless interaction between the user and the machine. This innovative project has vast potential for accessibility, making computer navigation more inclusive for individuals with physical limitations.
